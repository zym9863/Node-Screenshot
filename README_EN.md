## Technical Implementation

### File Structure

- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration file
- `popup.html`: Popup interface HTML
- `popup.js`: Popup interface interaction logic
- `popup_styles.css`: Popup styles
- `content.js`: Content script, handles page element selection
- `background.js`: Background script, handles screenshot logic
- `style.css`: Content script injected styles for highlighting elements

### How It Works

1. **Element Selection**:
   - When the user clicks the extension icon, `popup.js` sends a start selection message to `content.js` on the current page
   - `content.js` listens for mouse events and highlights elements as the mouse hovers over them
   - After the user clicks an element, `content.js` gets the element's position information

2. **Screenshot Processing**:
   - `content.js` sends the element position information to `background.js`
   - `background.js` uses Chrome API to capture a screenshot of the entire visible page
   - Screenshot data and element position information are stored in local storage

3. **Image Processing and Display**:
   - `popup.js` reads screenshot data and element position from local storage
   - Uses Canvas API to crop the selected element portion
   - Displays the cropped screenshot in the popup
   - Provides copy and download functionality

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 88+
- Chromium-based browsers (such as Edge, Opera, etc.)

## Permissions

This extension requires the following permissions:

- `activeTab`: Access to the current tab
- `scripting`: Inject and execute scripts
- `storage`: Store screenshot data
- `host_permissions`: Allow running on all websites
